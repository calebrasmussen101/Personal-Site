          Camping is one of the way's I find peace in the world. Were it is very
          fun working with technology and learning everyday at time is is nice
          to excape from the technology. My little family heads all around the
          state to find this inner peace. While some people find peace by a
          quite spa session we find peace by recklessly driving the four
          wheelers around, or even doing backflips of the side of the boat. But
          at the end of the night once the sun sets and the stars come out, and
          the sound of the crackling fire that is where I find my greatest
          peace. Everyone sitting around the fire telling stories roasting
          hotdogs and sipping on some whisky.<i

          As were I cant skate to safe me life hockey is one of my top items. Me
          and my wife will sit up each Saturday night watching games together.
          While she like watching the boring
          <strong><i>"Colorado Avalanche"</i></strong> play, I like to watch a
          much superior team <strong><i>"The San Jose Sharks"</i></strong
          >. Okay I get it the sharks arent doing so hot but they are still my
          team. Regardless the team we root for there will always be one team we
          always agree on our local minor leaque team
          <strong><i>"The Utah Grizzlies</i></strong
          >. Its no NHL team but there is nothing better then cheering on you
          own city in hopes they bring home the cup. Unfortunaly neither the
          Sharks or the Grizzlies have brought home a cup in my life, With the
          sharks not ever winning the cup and grizzlies last win in 1995 we
          arent looking so good. Hockey is about three usful day to day items
          those are.

          With these traits greatness can be achieved and has been for example
          the great
          <i> Wayne Gretzky</i>. But many young kids are on the move to dethrone
          the god himself.

          Through highschool to even now I still enjoy "Lighting Design". Most
          dont understand what lighting design is, well have you ever been to a
          concert and had this stupid light that keeps flashing in your eyes,
          yeah thats lighting design. Creating a display by alternating between
          diffrent lights and colors to assist a performer to look the best they
          can on stage. Unfortunatly I am not doing this on a stage with a band.
          Instead I have a bunch of equiptment that I mess around with at my
          house. At one point in my life I set out to do this every day as a
          career, but as great as that sounds being on the road every day all
          year round wasnt for me, so I decided to tone it down to a hobby with
          every once in a while setting up event lighting for freinds weddings.
